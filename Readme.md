Hello!

This is not the first project I've worked on to master my React pagination skills, but I can say it's by far the best, simplest, and neatest.

I followed a YouTube tutorial curated by Traversy Media (you can check it out (here)[https://youtu.be/IYCa1F-OWmk]). It was pretty easy to grasp after the second watch and I was able to use it to restructure the pagination of one of my projects, (GitHub Repo)[https://github.com/DrPrime01/my-github-repos]. It's live here at (https://my-github-repos-three.vercel.app/)[https://my-github-repos-three.vercel.app/].

That's all about this project. I'll update you later about further improvements.

Thanks for reading it.
